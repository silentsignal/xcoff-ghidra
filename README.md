Quick&Dirty XCOFF Loader for Ghidra
===================================

Based on Kaitai Struct - structure parser classes (like `Xcoff32`) should be generated from the structure declaration hosted in [this other repo](https://github.com/silentsignal/xcoff-ks).

TODO
----

* Implement missing substructures (see the KS repo)
* 64-bit support
* Proper registration of import/export symbols in Ghidra
